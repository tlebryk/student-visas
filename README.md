## Running the code 

- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your virtual environment. 
- You will need YELP_API_KEY set in your environment. You can generate a key at https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app. Copy the API Key into your environment by running `export YELP_API_KEY=<KEY HERE>` for bash. You can persistently do this by editing the `~/.bashrc` or `~./bash_profile`. On Windows, this can be achieved by running `SETX YELP_API_KEY <KEY HERE>`.
